Limited knowledge pokedex used for finding type advantages and disadvantages. For use in a discord server as a bot.

As of right now, you must create your own bot [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/) and add it to
your server [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#268954688) if you would like to use it in your own server.
Insert the bot's client ID into the appropriate field and click the link at the bottom of the page. You will also have
to compile the source code on your own. I may provide an executable in the future. Be sure to pass the bot's token in as
a command line parameter.
